        <h1>The Project</h1>
        <p>
            Using only Frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, AngularJS{​1.x​}) create a basic app that takes in the data-set we provide,
            uses a graphing/statistical library to display the requested views of the data and relevant statistics. Please initialize
            this as a new Github repo and be sure to commit early and often, once complete share the repo with us so we can test it out.
            Again don’t worry about creating any sort of Backend or Database for this app, it only needs to be viewable locally by opening
            the base HTML file in a browser.
